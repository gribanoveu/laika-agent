//! Which old tool results to replace with a one-line stub, and when.
//!
//! A file read in round two rides along in every later round of the turn, and
//! in every turn after it: the history is resent whole each time. Replacing
//! what the model has long since used with a note saying it was there costs
//! one re-read if it turns out to be needed again.
//!
//! **Against a prompt cache.** Every provider this app talks to caches by
//! prefix — DeepSeek from token zero, Anthropic up to its cache points — so
//! changing an old message makes everything after it a cache miss, once.
//! Hence the shape of the rule:
//!
//! * **Rarely.** Nothing happens below [`TRIGGER_TOKENS`] of history, where a
//!   miss costs more than the tokens cleared would save: on DeepSeek a cached
//!   input token is ~25× cheaper than a missed one, so clearing pays back
//!   through the rounds that follow, not at once.
//! * **In bulk.** When it does happen, everything eligible goes at once, and
//!   only if that is at least [`CLEAR_AT_LEAST_TOKENS`] — one miss per batch,
//!   not one per result per round.
//! * **Deterministically.** A stub is a function of the call alone, so the
//!   new prefix is cached from the next round on like any other.
//!
//! What stays: the last [`KEEP_RECENT_ROUNDS`] rounds' results, anything
//! under [`MIN_RESULT_TOKENS`], a loaded skill (instructions, not data), and
//! everything the model itself said — its reasoning included, which DeepSeek
//! requires back in full once tools are in play.
//!
//! DeepSeek evaluates its own agents with exactly this move under context
//! pressure — dropping earlier tool-call history outright (V3.2 report,
//! "Discard-all") — so a model trained there is not thrown by a result that
//! is gone.
//!
//! The rules only; applying them, and what else has to forget the cleared
//! results, is `services::llm_chat`'s.
