//! Turning text into vectors — the one model this app ships, and the seam a
//! test puts a fake behind.
//!
//! ## What upstream's 383 lines were, and why ~60 are left
//!
//! Upstream carries a second, remote provider: an OpenAI-compatible
//! `/embeddings` endpoint with its base URL, model name, dimensions, a pinned
//! CA certificate, extra request headers, a TLS-verification switch, presets,
//! a merged config and an API key in the keychain. The owner's decision for
//! this port (`docs/06-port-plan.md`, stage 5) is **the bundled model only**:
//! code and questions about it never leave the machine to be indexed. Every
//! type that existed to configure or resolve that choice has nothing to
//! choose between, and is gone with it.
//!
//! What stays is the trait. Not for a second provider — for tests: the sync
//! that fills the index must be exercised on hundreds of chunks without
//! loading half a gigabyte of weights into every test.
