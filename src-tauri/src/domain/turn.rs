//! The turn protocol: what a running turn reports, and how a paused one is
//! resumed.
//!
//! Everything a front end knows about a turn in flight arrives as one ordered
//! stream of [`ChatTurnEvent`], and the stream goes out through a sink rather
//! than through any UI type. That is what keeps the loop testable without a
//! window, and what lets the same loop serve a transcript, a log and a test.
//!
//! A turn ends one of three ways, and *pausing is one of them* — not an
//! exception routed around the normal path. A pause produces a complete
//! checkpoint the caller sends back to continue, because nothing here keeps
//! session state of its own between calls.

/// - `event_seq` — the last emitted sequence number. A resume continues from

///   makes a listener that reconnects mid-turn unable to order anything.
/// - `calls` — every call the round asked for, in order, including the ones

/// - `todos` — an earlier round of the same turn may already have changed the
