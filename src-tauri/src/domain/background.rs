//! Background processes (CA-4.5): a command that outlives the call that
//! started it — a dev server, a watcher, a long build.
//!
//! Started by `runCommand` with `background: true`, read with `readOutput`,
//! stopped with `stopProcess` or from the Terminal tab. Each lives until it
//! exits, is stopped, the workspace changes, or the app quits — not the turn:
//! a dev server the agent started has to be there when the next message
//! asks it something. Decisions in `docs/06-port-plan.md`, stage 7.
//!
//! The port is here and the processes are in `infra::background`, because
//! `ToolDeps` carries it and `domain` does not reach into `infra`.
