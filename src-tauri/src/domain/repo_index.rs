//! What the index knows about one file: which language it is, what named
//! things are in it, and enough about its bytes to tell a rebuild from a
//! no-op.
//!
//! No content here. A repository of thousands of files would otherwise hold a
//! second copy of the working tree in memory before a single chunk exists. The
//! index describes the project; it does not duplicate the filesystem.
//!
//! ## One difference from Alfa Atlas, and it is the point of the layer
//!
//! Upstream's [`detect_language`] returns `Option<Language>`, and
//! `RepositoryIndex::update_file` **deletes the file from the index** when it
//! comes back `None`. With five languages — AsciiDoc, Markdown, Java, JSON,
//! YAML — that quietly drops `.txt`, `.puml` and `.mmd` from search while
//! leaving them visible to `grep` (`docs/07-upstream-findings.md`, B-8).
//!
//! Here it would drop almost everything: this repository is 56 `.rs`, 22
//! `.tsx`, 22 `.ts` and no `.java` at all. So the function returns a
//! `Language`, never an `Option`: a file nobody wrote a parser for is
//! [`Language::PlainText`] and gets whole-file chunks. The contract is one
//! sentence — **a file the scan accepted gets chunks** — and it is enforced by
//! the return type rather than by every caller remembering it.

/// What the index knows how to read.
///
/// Three groups, and the difference between them is what a parser buys:
///
/// * [`PlainText`](Language::PlainText) — no parser. Whole-file chunks. Not a
///   failure mode: a real language of the index, and the one most files are.
/// * [`Json`](Language::Json) and [`Yaml`](Language::Yaml) — no parser either,
///   and chunked the same way, but named. "This is configuration, not prose"
///   is worth knowing at query time even when the bytes are handled alike.
/// * The rest — a tree-sitter grammar, so chunks follow functions and headings
///   instead of a byte count.
///
/// ## Where the grammars come from
///
/// The official grammar crates, one dependency each, read by a single generic
/// tree walk in `infra::language_indexers`. A language is a crate plus a row
/// naming the nodes worth keeping.
///
/// Upstream could not do that. Its set is Java, JSON, YAML, Markdown and
/// AsciiDoc, and it had to drop Kotlin: `tree-sitter` declared
/// `links = "tree-sitter"`, which allows one version of it in the entire build
/// graph, and `tree-sitter-asciidoc` needed a newer runtime than
/// `tree-sitter-kotlin` permitted. **That constraint is gone.** Current
/// grammars depend on the small `tree-sitter-language` crate and declare no
/// `links` at all — checked 2026-09-17 against `tree-sitter-rust` 0.24.2 and
/// `tree-sitter-typescript` 0.23.2, both of which do.
///
/// A bundle such as `ast-grep-language` was weighed and passed over. It exists
/// to solve exactly the conflict above, which no longer happens; what it costs
/// is `ast_grep_core` — a pattern matcher, an AST wrapper and meta-variables —
/// in the build graph to obtain a `tree_sitter::Language` that a grammar crate
/// hands over in one line, and a feature flag whose absence is
/// `unimplemented!()` at runtime rather than an error at compile time. Revisit
/// it if this list ever grows past a dozen languages, where curating versions
/// by hand becomes real work.
