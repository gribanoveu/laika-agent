//! Ported from Alfa Atlas `domain/ai_access.rs`, which was 646 lines. Most of
//! it did not survive: `AiAccessMode` (`DocsOnly`/`FullRepo`) was specific to a
//! documentation product — here the access root is always the repository, and
//! it is enforced where paths are resolved, not by a mode enum. The per-project
//! tool allowlist went with it: its own fallback returned every variant that
//! existed, and there was no UI to narrow it, so it guarded nothing. It belongs
//! back only once something can actually configure it.
//!
//! What is left is the part that was load-bearing: which tools may not run
//! unattended, what a call costs the loop, and the wire names the model uses.
