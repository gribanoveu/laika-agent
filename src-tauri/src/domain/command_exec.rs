//! Running a command: what is asked for, what comes back, and how much of it
//! the model is allowed to read.
//!
//! ## This is the tool that ends containment
//!
//! Every other tool resolves its paths against the workspace root, and that
//! root is a real boundary (`services::ai_tools::resolve`). A command line is
//! not: `cat ../../.ssh/id_rsa` is a perfectly ordinary command, and no amount
//! of checking the working directory changes that. So `cwd` is resolved inside
//! the root for the same reason a `cd` is convenient, **not** as a security
//! measure, and the honest statement is that from here on the approval gate is
//! the only boundary there is.
//!
//! A sandbox (CA-4.7) is what would change that. There is a place for one in
//! the runner's interface and no implementation behind it; until there is,
//! nothing here should be described as containing anything.
//!
//! ## Why a shell, and which one
//!
//! The command runs through a shell, because a coding agent's commands are
//! shell commands: `cargo test 2>&1 | tail -20`, `cd crate && make`. Parsing
//! an argv ourselves would reject those, and the model would have to discover
//! by trial which half of its vocabulary works.
//!
//! Which shell is a setting, not a search of `PATH`. On Windows the difference
//! between `cmd`, PowerShell and Git Bash is not cosmetic — the same line means
//! different things in each — and a tool that silently picks one produces
//! failures nobody can reproduce.
