//! Cutting an indexed file into addressable pieces.
//!

//! (slicing, hashing, naming, numbering), once, for every language.
//!
//! Both are pure. Upstream kept the strategies in `infra/chunk_strategies/`
//! behind a trait and a `HashMap`, and the builder in a service because it
//! read the file through the repository index; neither needs anything but the

//! No embeddings here and no search. This layer answers "what are the pieces",
//! and nothing about what is done with them.

//! Ported from Alfa Atlas with one defect fixed rather than carried: see
//! [`spans_from_forward_gap_symbols`].
