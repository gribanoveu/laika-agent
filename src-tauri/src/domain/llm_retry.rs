//! Whether a failed round may be tried again, and how long to wait first.
//!
//! Pure decision, no sleeping and no I/O: the turn loop owns the waiting
//! because it is the only place that can keep the wait cancellable and tell
//! the UI why nothing is happening. What lives here is the part with rules
//! worth testing.
//!
//! This is *not* the rate-limit accounting Alfa Atlas has. That models one
//! corporate gateway's own window from the client side and answers "how much
//! budget is left"; this answers "the request was refused, now what" — which
//! is what a public API actually does to a long turn, and which Atlas does not
//! handle at all (see `docs/06-port-plan.md`, F-1.13).
