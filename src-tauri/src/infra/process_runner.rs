//! Starting a command, reading what it says, and making sure it is dead.
//!
//! ## Killing the tree, not the child
//!
//! `Child::kill()` signals exactly one process. A shell command is almost never
//! one process: `cargo test` spawns compilers and test binaries, and
//! `sh -c 'server & sleep 30'` leaves the server running after the shell it was
//! started from is gone. A timeout that kills only the direct child therefore
//! *looks* like it worked — the call returns — while the work it was supposed
//! to stop keeps running, holding the port, the lock, or the CPU.
//!
//! So the child is started in its own process group and the whole group is
//! signalled. That is what the grandchild test checks, and it is the one test
//! in this suite that has to wait in real time.
//!
//! ## Reading output
//!
//! Both streams are read by their own threads, because a command that fills the
//! pipe it is not being read from blocks forever, and because the model should
//! see a long build progressing rather than nothing until the end. Output is
//! read as bytes, not as lines of text: a compiler is free to emit a byte
//! sequence that is not UTF-8, and a reader that errors on it would lose the
//! whole run over one character.
