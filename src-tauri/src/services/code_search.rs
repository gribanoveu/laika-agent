//! Search of the open folder's code: names first, then words and meaning
//! fused into one ranking.
//!
//! A declaration named as the query spells it comes first — nothing a ranker
//! says outweighs a name the caller got right. Words (BM25) and meaning
//! (embeddings) are peers: `fuse_rrf` merges their rankings rather than
//! picking one, because "these words appear here" and "this passage means
//! that" are different evidence, and a chunk carrying both beats one carrying
//! either.
//!
//! The constants below were set by the quality bench (F-5.13c,
//! `services/search_bench.rs`, 67 questions over three repositories), not by
//! taste; `docs/06-port-plan.md` has the numbers. Upstream's stem tier is not
//! ported — the full-text index matches prefixes and weighs chunk names four
//! to one. Its path tier came back as [`PATH_BOOST`].
