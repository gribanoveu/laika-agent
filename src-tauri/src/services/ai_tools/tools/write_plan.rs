//! `writePlan` — the conversation's plan, as a document the user reads and
//! edits in the Plan tab.
//!
//! Stateless like `todo`: the plan belongs to the chat, is sent into each
//! turn by the window and comes back out of this call's arguments. The
//! result is a receipt, not the text again — the model has just written it,
//! and echoing it would put every plan into the context twice.
//!
//! Replaces Alfa Atlas's plan store (`services/plans.rs`, four tools): a
//! plan here lives with the chat, beside the checklist, rather than in a
//! second store with a second list of steps.
