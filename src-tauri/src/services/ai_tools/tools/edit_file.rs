//! `editFile` — anchored replacements inside a file that already exists.
//!
//! Exact and all-or-nothing. Every anchor is looked up in the file's original
//! content, never in the output of an earlier edit in the same call, which is
//! what makes a batch independent of its own ordering. An anchor that matches
//! nothing, matches more than once, or overlaps another edit's region rejects
//! the entire call before anything reaches the disk.
//!
//! Alfa Atlas has a second path this does not port: when an exact match fails,
//! `fast_apply` hands the whole file and the edit's intent to the model and
//! asks it to make the change, then checks that everything outside the edited
//! region is byte-identical. It is ingenious and it turns a deterministic tool
//! into another model call, with that cost and that variance. A failed anchor
//! is already a precise, actionable error; the model can widen it and retry.
