//! Turning a path the model wrote into a real path on disk.
//!
//! The enforcement point for CA-3.9: every tool that takes a path comes
//! through here, and nothing else is trusted to have checked. A tool cannot
//! widen its own access by passing an unexpected path — only a `ToolScope`
//! built with a wider root could.
//!
//! Merged from Alfa Atlas `domain/paths.rs` (427 lines) and
//! `services/ai_tools/resolve.rs` (488). Most of both was the two-root world:
//! a path could be spelled relative to the documentation subtree *or* to the
//! repository, so resolution tried aliases, and results had to be translated
//! between the two namespaces. One root deletes all of it — `path_aliases`,
//! `docs_root_prefixes`, `stripped_docs_prefixes`, `docs_rel_to_access_rel`,
//! `to_access_relative`, `access_and_docs_rel`, `resolve_mutable_docs_path`
//! and the `@deps` split are gone. What survives is the containment check and
//! the two traps it walks around, both documented at their fix.
//!
//! This reaches for `std::fs` directly rather than through an infra trait.
//! Containment cannot be decided without resolving symlinks, so the
//! filesystem is not an implementation detail here — it is the thing being
//! asked. A trait would have exactly one implementation and one test double
//! that could not answer the question truthfully anyway.
