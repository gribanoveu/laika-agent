/**
 * A control whose value lives on the backend, and the one rule about changing
 * it: the control moves **after** the backend has agreed.
 *
 * Both of the composer's chips are this. The backend is where each setting is
 * enforced — one decides which tools reach the model, the other whether a call
 * pauses for a human — so a chip that moved first would be showing a state the
 * agent is not in. "Plan" over a turn that is still armed, or "Ask" over one
 * that will not ask, is worse than the old label for a moment longer.
 *
 * `pick` returns the reason on failure rather than raising or toasting: a hook
 * does not know where this app puts its errors.
